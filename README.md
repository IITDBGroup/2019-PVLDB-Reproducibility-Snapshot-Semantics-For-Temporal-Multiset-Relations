# Reproducibility Instructions for "Snapshot Semantics for Temporal Multiset Relations"

## Information

-    The title and abstract of your original, accepted pVLDB paper.
-    A link to your original, accepted pVLDB paper.
-    A short description of how the reviewer may retrieve your reproducibility submission. This should include at least the following information: a link to the code and how to use the scripts for (a) code compilation, (b) data generation, (c) experimentation.
-    A short description of the hardware needed to run your code and reproduce experiments included in the paper, with detailed specification of unusual or not commercially available hardware. If your hardware is sufficiently specialized, please have plans to allow the reviewers to access your hardware.
-    A short description of any software or data necessary to run your code and reproduce experiments included in the paper, particularly if it is restricted-access (e.g., commercial software without a free demo or academic version). If this is the case, please have plans to allow the reviewers access to any necessary software or data.

## Datasets

## Software

We ran all experiments using our implementation of the rewriting for sequenced temporal queries in GProM. GProM compiles such queries into SQL code for various backend SQL dialects. In our experiments we used three backend databases.


### GProM

### PostgreSQL

### Temporal PostgreSQL

### Oracle
